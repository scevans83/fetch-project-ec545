# Fetch!

This is a project for EC545 Cyberphysical Systems at Boston University. The goal of this project is to design a controller for the Rosmaster X3 to play a game of fetch, where it searches for and finds a ball in the environment, before searching for and return the ball to a goal location. 

## Project Structure

- The `InitialFunctionality` directory contains proofs-of-concept, tests, and other functions in progress.
- The `custom-ros-packages` directory contains the four ROS melodic compatible packages that implement the fetch controller. (NOTE: this does not contain all the necessary dependent packages, which can be found on the rosmaster x3 setup page [here](http://www.yahboom.net/study/ROSMASTER-X3)
